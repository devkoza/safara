  description:
  "BBIIEx Tag Team III, a Viking Billfish, has been turning heads ever since it got to Cabo. A telltale sign of the excitement around it is that all the Captains and crews have been itching to check it out and keeping fingers crossed for a day out on the water on board. The brand new, Viking Billfish is a true accomplishment from Viking; providing the whole package for anglers looking for luxury, stability and comfort found on larger sportfishers with the speed and maneuverability of a center console. As Marlin Magazine puts it, The Billfish is equipped for serious fishing. It incorporates reliable Cummins 550-horsepower  QSB 6.7 diesels, bow thruster and the ability to back down and a turn on a dime, giving it the finesse of a prima ballerina with that of a spirited sports car. This vessel packs a punch and reach speeds of up to 40 mph.",
